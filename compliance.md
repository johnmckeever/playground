Using Random Function.md) | Identify Transformers (or other stages) using Random functions which produce non-deterministic output. | \n| [Flow Using Transformer Surrogate Key](Flow Using Transformer Surrogate Key.md) | Identifies flow designs that use NextSurrogateKey() in a Transformer. | \n| [Hardcoded DB Credentials](Hardcoded DB Credentials.md) | Ensures that all Database Connectors must use variables for location and credentials | \n| [Hardcoded File Paths](Hardcoded File Paths.md) | Ensures that all File Stages must use variables for determining paths | \n| [Join Partition vs Join Key](Join Partition vs Join Key.md) | Reports Join stages where the join key does not match the partitioning of the input links. | \n| [Link Sort](Link Sort.md) | Identifies link sorts. | \n| [Log Column Values](Log Column Values.md) | Identify Stages configured to Log column values on first row error | \n| [Lookup Failure](Lookup Failure.md) | Identifies Lookup Stages with Lookup set to Fail.
